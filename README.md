# DevBlog

This project was built for tech users/peer developers, it is a CMS-style blog site.
Users can publish articles, blog posts, and comments.
Users also have the ability to create a profile: login/logout feature with a dashboard that displays all their posts/articles, with update and delete post features.
The comment feature gives users the ability to comment on other users' posts.
